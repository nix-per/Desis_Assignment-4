## DESCRIPTION:

The assignment consisted of C++ problems with subdivisions among questions on the basis of the topics they were concerned with. 

Hence, the solution has also been presented in a similar fashion.

C++ files containing the same code as the one run on their respective links has been copied into the files, with the same name as that of the problem statement.

The files for "Basic Math" category only contain the solution code and NOT THE driver code, due to restrictions of the GFG Shell Platform.
